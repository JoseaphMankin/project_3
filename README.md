No Regrets IN REACT

## Value Add Proposal

*Taking the groundwork laid by project 2's Angular project, converting to React with the intent of taking the app to the next level. By the end of the project, be able to understand the pros/cons of using Angular vs React in our ability. 	
*"No Regrets - Your sober wingman, so you don't have to be. Protecting yourself from yourself since 2018"

## Tech Stack	
The application demonstrates the ability to use a full MERN Stack.
[Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/)
[Express](https://expressjs.com/)
[React](https://reactjs.org/)
[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Deployed using Heroku with Data.	git p
Leaving the option open for MySQL Database with Sequelize to track our Internal Users / Sessions. Folder structure that meets MVP Paradigm.

Drink Database to import Drink Items w/ alcohol content.	
BAC Database. We may need to convert a public table to our own private table.


## Roles / Strengths / Learning Goals

- Wes: Full Stack - Figuring out what John is doing.
- John: Full Stack - Figuring out what Casey is doing.
- Casey: Full Stack - Figuring out what Joe is doing.

## MVP	
PHASE ONE	
* Convert Angular version over to React. Get to a place where a user can Create an Account that can track drinking log, across multiple sessions w/ Persistance.

PHASE TWO	
* Addition of Drinks starts a timer until you are sober again based on BAC table/database/api. Creating a budget that will countdown how much money you've spent. 
* Once over the limit, implement additional functionality. Call an Uber/ Either as a simple link or an API
* See if we can get Authentication working. (Auth0, Passport, GoogleFirebase Auth)

PHASE THREE	
* Combat the "Hangover Gremlin" by drinking water.	
* Target BAC levels / Drinks until drunk. 

NICE TO HAVES
* Test Driven Development integrated utilized through development.
*
