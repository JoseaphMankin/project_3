No Regrets IN REACT

## Value Add Proposal

Taking the groundwork laid by project 2's Angular project, converting to React with the intent of taking the app to the next level. 	
** "No Regrets - Your sober wingman, so you don't have to be. Protecting yourself from yourself since 2018"

## Tech Stack	
The application demonstrates the ability to use a full MERN Stack.
[Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/)
[Express](https://expressjs.com/)
[React](https://reactjs.org/)
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Deployed using Heroku with Data.	
Leaving the option open for SQL Database to track our Internal Users / Sessions

Drink Database to import Drink Items w/ alcohol content.	
BAC Database. We may need to convert a public table to our own private table.

## Roles / Strengths

- Joe: Full Stack -	Figuring out what Wes is doing
- Wes: Full Stack - Figuring out what John is doing
- John: Full Stack - Figuring out what Casey is doing
- Casey: Full Stack - Figuring out what Joe is doing

## MVP	
PHASE ONE	
* Convert Angular version over to React. Get to a place where a user can Create an Account that can track drinking log, across multiple sessions w/ Persistance.

PHASE TWO	
* Addition of Drinks starts a timer until you are sober again based on BAC table/database/api. Creating a budget that will countdown how much money you've spent. 
* Once over the limit, implement additional functionality. Call an Uber/ Either as a simple link or an API

PHASE THREE	
* Combat the "Hangover Gremlin" by drinking water.	
* Target BAC levels / Drinks until drunk.
